========================
Django template project
========================
Based on
* https://github.com/twoscoops/django-twoscoops-project
A project template for Django 1.7 (with a tag for Django 1.5).

To use this project follow these steps:

#. Create your working environment
#. Install Django
#. Install additional dependencies


Working Environment
===================

You have several options in setting up your working environment.  We recommend
using virtualenv to separate the dependencies of your project from your system's
python environment.  If on Linux or Mac OS X, you can also use virtualenvwrapper to help manage multiple virtualenvs across different projects.

Virtualenv Only
---------------

First, make sure you are using virtualenv (http://www.virtualenv.org). Once
that's installed, create your virtualenv::

    $ virtualenv env

You will also need to ensure that the virtualenv has the project directory
added to the path. Adding the project directory will allow `django-admin.py` to
be able to change settings using the `--settings` flag.

Virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper
------------------------------------

In Linux and Mac OSX, you can install virtualenvwrapper (http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/),
which will take care of managing your virtual environments and adding the
project path to the `site-directory` for you::

    $ mkdir env
    $ mkvirtualenv -a env env-dev
    $ cd env && add2virtualenv `pwd`

Using virtualenvwrapper with Windows
----------------------------------------

There is a special version of virtualenvwrapper for use with Windows (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper-win).::

    > mkdir env
    > mkvirtualenv env-dev
    > add2virtualenv env


Depending on where you are installing dependencies:

In development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

For production::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

*note: We install production requirements this way because many Platforms as a
Services expect a requirements.txt file in the root of projects.*
